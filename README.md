# GLIGHTS
GLIGHTS is side project and business I'm working on along side one of my friends.  
Our product is an LED strip that attaches to the backside of a monitor and changes the colour of the LEDs to match the colour on screen. This creates a beautiful lightshow effect while watching shows or gaming.  
I handled all the software and hardware development. The software was developed using the C# and the .NET framework. This application runs in the backround and gets color data from the respective areas on the screen and sends that data via serial port to an Arduino Nano, which decodes the data and sets the color of LEDs.
